### About
This is an educational project. Our team created KRAB as a task on infoShare Academy course.  
### How we did it?
We started with brainstorming through every idea. Thanks to Figma and Miro, a UX model has occured.  \
After creating a complex scheme of every view, our team figured out which element should fire after which user's action.  \
And then the fun BEGAN!
